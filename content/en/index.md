# Transformation?

*transform-social* is about the possibilities of transforming into more social, more solidary,
more free, and less coercive societies.

[Transform into free and solidary societies](/texte/transform/) is an overview article including
criticism of existing societies, characteristics for free and solidary societies, and ideas on how to get there.

Why do we need transformation? What are the problems of current societies and economic systems?
The criticism of the existing is a good starting point for problem analysis and a source of motivation.

Capitalism clearly doesn't work. It does not meet the needs of the people and is in permanent crisis.

Capitalism leads to military conflicts, which is criticized in [Antimilitarism](/texte/antimilitarism/).

Capitalism is also one cause of [Racism](/texte/racism/), which is interwoven in
many layers of our current society. This has to change.

[Challenging the one true love](/texte/love/) speculates about how capitalism profits
from heteronormative relationships.

What could transformations develop into? What would more free and more solidary societies be like?
Here, Utopias are defined as feasible and constantly developing concepts to give
orientation to the transformation.

[CyberSyn](/texte/cybersyn/) describes the cybernetic ideas for the economy of Chile in 1971-1973.

[Tools for Emancipatory Societies](/texte/tools/) is a lengthy text about the requirements and tools
for free and solidary societies.

How can we strive towards utopias? How can the transformation happen?

We don't have to wait for the revolution. We can and should start
living the ideas of utopia in the current society as best as possible,
thus creating building blocks (both infrastructure and capabilities)
that support a successful transformation. This is sometimes referred to
as prefigurative politics and sometimes just lived.

Some examples:

- [Anarchy and Responsibility](/texte/responsibility/) is about tackling conflicts in intentional communities
- [Rethinking Relationships](/texte/relationships/) is about the rejection of relationship norms
