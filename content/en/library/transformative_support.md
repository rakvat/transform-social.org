Catchphrases: That the only way stuff is really going to get any different is to call each other on shit and then learn how to do it better the next time around. | The criminal injustice apparatus, which systematically targets and brutalizes communities of color, radical and queer communities and immigrants, is not the first place many of us think to call when we are under attack. | Look at the power dynamics. Gender difference is obviously not the only factor that causes power imbalances in a relationship. | Inter Transformative Support team communication can be tricky.

How can conflicts be resolved in anarchist projects or anarchist societies if there are to be no hierarchical power structures,
i.e. no military and no police? How does a group that has given itself free agreements deal with behavior that runs counter to these agreements?
This text uses the example of conflicts in the field of intimate violence to show what such conflict resolution might look like.
We won't just need other forms of organization but also other values and thought patterns.
