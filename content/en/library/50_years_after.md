A pleasant to read "serial novel" that describes in great detail what life in a libertarian-communist (or anarchist) world might be like.
Everything is covered: From the personal life of Ri and Ti, to the federal system, the information system, the organization of work,
the distribution of products, measures taken when free agreements are violated, the education of children, youth and adults,
and overcoming the greenhouse effect, to the course of the revolution 50 years ago and the anniversary celebrations.
This text does not intend to be a manual, but answers many "can this be possible?" questions, makes anarchy pictorially
imaginable and tangible, and encourages further thought and experimentation.
