Catchphrases: Individuals or organisations will draw from these stocks as they need them, and, in case of insufficient quantities, after an agreement with other consumers and interested organisations.|To give to each proportionally to their work is, if you wish, a fair principle; but it is a lower type of justice, like the idea of rewarding merit or punishing vice.|We reject therefore the idea itself of a wage; we dissociate the two issues of production and of consumption, leaving between them only the link which results from the fact that the total quantity of produced goods must be indexed on the consumption needs.

One of my favorite texts on anarchist economics.
Especially part 3 is a very good and concise description of what we could aim for.
Of course, after more than 100 years, our situation is a bit different and we have other
[tools](/en/texts/tools) at hand, but the anarchist principles are still valid.
