Catchphrases: bolo’bolo is also a modest proposal for the new arrangements on the spaceship after the Machine’s disappearance.|The Work Machine has a planetary character, so a successful bolo’bolo strategy must also be planetary from the outset.|Since people aren’t working for a marketplace, and only secondarily for exchange, there is no longer any distinction between crafts/arts, vocation/job, working time/free time, inclination/economic necessity (with the exception of some basic maintenance work).


An anarchist draft from the beginning of the 80s, which,
in addition to a description of the catastrophic conditions of the current capitalist system and the need for change,
describes a detailed version of an anarchist society. In addition to human coexistence and the possibility of
co-existence of different lifestyles, linguistic, urban planning, and economic issues are thought through.
